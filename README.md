Intro to the world of web development and beyond.
Long time on looker in the programming world, held hostage by malicious cyber terrorits in Canada. After another loss in the world due to lies and conspiracies committed by obssessive monitoring enthusiasts, I have made a conscious effort to commence and conclude all studies that I have been trying to attempt since 2013/14. I hope to be able to develop a skill set that commands respect and be able to pay a proper and dignified respect to people who created so many infused technologies in our world. I hope I can integrate the "developing" world into my world amidst a world of entitlement plagued "first world problems".
